\section{Introduction}

Telus Health is a “TELUS Health is a leader in telehomecare, electronic medical and health records, consumer health, benefits management and pharmacy management.”\cite{telusComp}. With the recent acquisition of Med Access Inc., Telus is “confirmed as the largest EMR (Electronic Medical Record) provider in Canada”\cite{telusComp}. This title has encouraged Telus to provide service with higher quality. In January 2014， I was assigned to the VIP room to implement a web service that mainly contains a drug claim searching and benefit management feature. This particular feature allows different levels of users such as patient, insurer and pharmacist to access the patient's record of drug claims and payments. After a certain amount of designing and coding, it came to the point where some basic testing for the code was necessary. I believe that even elementary testings should be carefully designed for future documentation and reproduction. \\

Functionality testing has always been one of the most important tasks in the quality assurance (abbreviated as QA) process. All companies are working to discover a testing method which is able to cover all sources of error, requires minimal human effort and consumes least amount of time. It is especially important for Telus Health, a company which has adapted the Agile software development system, to have a highly efficient QA process in order to accommodate the fast pace of the system. At Telus, agile development is structured as series of “sprint cycles.” Every aspect of the development process, including technical requirements, design etc., are continually revisited throughout the lifecycle of the project. As a consequence, a series of developing and testing will take place. As illustrated in Figure 1, the testing phase appears on a intense frequency, which results in many high demands on the tests' quality, efficiency etc. These demands will be considered as criteria to evaluate a testing approach later on in the report.\\

This report provides an evaluation of three functionality testing methods, assessing their 
suitability to the VIP room web service. You will first be introduced to the VIP room work flow. Then, the three approaches for testing will be explained and compared in detail. Comparisons will be made among various criteria and will be finalized using the Decision Matrix Analysis. Finally, the report summarizes the results of the analysis, draws 
conclusions, and makes a recommendation. The reader is expected to have reasonable background in web service development. Basic knowledge in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)would also help the reader quickly understand one of the approaches. Other technology and terminologies used in this report will be explained on their first appearance.\\
