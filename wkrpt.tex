	Telus Health provides health and related transaction record for clients of medical insurance companies. I was situated in the new VIP room team, which is responsible for rebuilding a web service for clients to look up their drug claim transaction history. During my time in Telus, I was assigned to study the pre-existing interface and to extract data from existing log files.
}
{
	The following report performs an analysis on the different techniques for testing features implemented in VIP room. This problem is one that I encountered during my work term, as a high-level interface was needed for the automation tool that was to be implemented. My team had to decide which interface was best suited to the task given all the requirements and factors.
